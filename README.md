# About this project

Yeah this is an mod of SPD with Arknights IP,like sprite and something else.Somehow like korean project but we have almost none spriter(even fewer on work now)Believe it or not,we have created it in 2020-1,but it was a sprite—only modifier at first.

This project is based on SPD 0.6.5,but after I added libgdx import,improved change interface,updated badage system and other polish in later version,it has had and will keep in track of highlight changes in SPD.

# Contact:
Again,be in lack of almost everything,from pictures,data,design,even time to code.So if you want to take part in its creation,you can contact me by e-mail,in English or Chinese.
